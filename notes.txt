the date of start is 27th august,2018 with name STARS
it is my very first personal project 
the problem is to print in stars(*) for inputs of words and numbers
Numbers have been seperately given specific methods to print their star output. 
here 5x5 tiles have been followed for now
the case is applicable for single digits only so far
now target is to merge numbers for display
the numbers have been mergef side by side in a single line successfully
now its time to add words to the input as well
the problem is "O" , "D", "0" and "8","B" get mixed up
words successfully done now lets check spaces
a single sentence is applicable now as well
100% complete 
ended on 30th august,2018.
